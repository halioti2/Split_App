# Product Brief — Split Payments App (APB Demo)

## Problem
Splitting shared expenses among friends is error-prone and fragmented across chats and payment apps. People want a fast, trustworthy way to record expenses, see who owes whom, and settle up — on any device, on the go.

## Audience
- Small friend groups in NYC (dining, groceries, trips, events)
- Casual usage on mobile (iPhone Safari and Android Chrome) with occasional desktop review

## Value Proposition
- Record expenses in seconds, see net balances instantly
- Minimal set of suggested transfers to settle up fairly
- Cloud sync with accounts so anyone can log in anywhere

## Differentiators
- Ruthless MVP that’s fast on mobile
- Clear balances and minimal settlements (not just lists of IOUs)
- Works with your existing payment app (Venmo/Cash App/PayPal) but does not require one

## Core Use Cases
- Dinner split (equal)
- Grocery runs (one person pays multiple times, everyone shares equally)
- Event tickets (subset of group participates)
- Weekend trip (mix of equal and one-off custom shares — v1.1)

## Metrics (MVP)
- Time-to-record expense (< 20s)
- Time-to-understand balances (< 10s)
- First-session retention (return within 48h)

## Out of Scope (MVP)
- In-app money movement (Stripe/Connect/KYC)
- Complex custom split editors (percentages, weights) — backlog
- Invites/roles/notifications

## Demo Story (60s)
